## Hi all,

Thanks to everyone who tuned in before! So great to hear your ideas for Open Garden Day 2022 (Sat. June 4th) - especially ways to support each other's gardens in North Brooklyn and ways to welcome neighbors into the gardens! 

[Attached are the notes from the discussion](/blog/notes-3-2-2022). And below is a recap of the next steps! Please feel free to chime in if anything is missing.

The next planning meeting is Tues. 4/5 from 6:30-8:00pm. Zoom link below! (And apologies for the confusion with the Zoom link - I've set the same link we used for future meetings going forward.)

Thanks all,
K.C.

## Next Steps:
K.C.: Check in with the DOT about the idea of a map of all of the gardens for a future self-guided tour, in addition to the map for Open Garden Day 2022 specifically

K.C. & Participating Gardens: Finalize the stops and bike route by <code>Tues. 3/15 to solidify with the DOT </code>

Aim to have fewer formal stops and focus on connecting the gardens overall

Check in about indicating public restrooms and Citibike stops on the map

Reps from Powers Street & Red Shed Garden: Discuss the idea of a final event to conclude the route and see what members are interested in, access to power / bathrooms, etc.

<code>Participating Gardens: By Fri. 4/1</code>, each garden participating in Open Garden Day 2022 should send in a short description and a couple of photos to K.C. and Sam (for print flyers about how to join the gardens and for Sam to add to the website)

<code> Participating Gardens: By Fri. 4/29</code>, each garden could aim to send K.C. and Sam more details about activities for Open Garden Day, in order to promote over social media etc.

* Sam is interested in helping to create sample social media posts
* Ariel to check in with her husband about creating a graphic / flyer for 2022 Open Garden Day in North Brooklyn
* K.C.: Follow up with NBPA to see if they are interested in doing video / social media profiles of gardens
* Mary and Stephen are interested in thinking about donations from local businesses (ex. Snacks, giveaways, t-shirts / safety vests, etc.)
* David is interested in reaching out to local bike shops to see if any of them would be interested in offering free bike repairs, etc. for the bike tour
* Kathy mentioned that Transportation Alternatives could offer free bike lights

## To Discuss:
* Bike Rack
* Creating Facebook event
* Creating “Passport” for kids / participants between gardens

Reaching out to local press
