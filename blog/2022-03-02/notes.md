● Go-around (or put in the chat): What are you hoping to see for Open Garden Day in
North Brooklyn? What’s your vision for the day?
○ David (Red Shed Garden) - having people get together and learn more about the
different gardens
○ Lori (61 Franklin Street Garden) - first public event since COVID, haven’t had first
member meeting yet and we’ll talk about it then; want it to be a joyous occasion
with food, activities for a wide age range, a stop along the bike tour, participate in
the oral history project
○ Lisa Bloodgood (La Casita Verde) - COVID was hard on our garden so having a
chance to celebrate the space, help welcome people into the garden, have fun
and meet our neighbors
○ Katie Levinson (Green Dome) - COVID was also tough for our garden, we always
have people walk into our garden, so having a dedicated day for people to come
see the space
○ Stephen Lewis (Red Shed Garden, Friends of Cooper Park) - seeing the road,
more of my neighborhood
○ John Rauchenberger (Northside Community Garden) - energize people and
welcome people back into the gardens

○ Ariel Willmott (Red Shed Garden) - excited to be on-site and welcome people into
the garden
○ Mary Witke (Powers Street Garden, Olive Street Garden, Red Shed Garden) -
excited to support the bike tour
○ Kathy Park Price (Transportation Alternatives) - looking forward to checking out
more of the gardens in North Brooklyn
● Updates on bike tour logistics
○ **Open Garden Day NYC is Saturday 6/4** ; overall timefor Open Garden Day
NYC to be determined but flexible to accommodate different types of events
throughout the day
**○ Rain date - Sunday 6/**
○ Recap updates from the DOT, Citibike, Transportation Alternatives (K.C.)


■ Transportation Alternatives Marshal Guide
■ DOT is happy to put together print / pdf maps of the bike tour and give
feedback on the route safety again, like they did in 2021
● Example ofsign-up formandmapfor the Eastern BrooklynBike
Tour that was in May 2021 from 1-5pm on a Saturday afternoon
for a total of 5.2 miles and 9 stops.
■ Lisa’s question about having a map of the route for the day and a
self-guided map of all the gardens for future reference → **can the DOT
help us with this? Especially if it included the open hours and social
media info**
■ Citibike is offering free discount codes for bikes; just need to dock every
two hours to extend the free rental
■ North Brooklyn Activist Committee of TA would be the main partner - Juan
and Kevin as co-chairs and volunteers
○ Review / discussproposed route(~6-7 miles total);
■ Idea of having some gardens give tours of their spaces and others along
the route that we point out as we bike past; trying to balance overall
length / accessibility and giving a good introduction to the different
community gardens in North Brooklyn
■ Proposed stops ( **bold** means that these gardens havesigned up via the
form or expressed interest already)
● **Green Dome** - starting point
● **61 Franklin St.** - stop / pass by
● Java Street Garden - stop
● Bike alongBrooklyn Greenway, past Bushwick InletPark and
Domino Park
● Berry Street Garden - pass by
● El Puente: Espiritu Tierra Community Garden - stop
● **La Casita Verde** - stop
● Ten Eyck Garden - pass by
● **Sunshine Community Garden** - stop
● **Powers Street Garden** - stop
● Olive Street Garden - pass by
● **Red Shed Garden** - final stop? (or Lentol Garden, anothermile?)
■ Feedback on the route:
● David: Length seems reasonable overall
● John: Could alter the route to pass by Northside Community
Garden
● Lisa: Could use the furthest most gardens as the stopping points
and 1-2 other gardens throughout; could cover the whole route;
idea of noisemakers for bikers
● Stephen: Could we include Friends of Cooper Park’s native
pollinator garden? We have a lot of space where people could
gather


● Lisa: Similarly, adding McCarren Park Demonstration Garden and
the Manhattan Avenue Street End Park, both friends of groups
that are caring for park spaces and have pollinator gardens
● ****Could aim to have fewer formal stops on the route and aim
to connect as many of the gardens as possible, that we pass
by
● **Could note where there are public restrooms on the map
(Cooper Park has restrooms), Citibike stops, etc.
● **Need to finalize the route by mid-March to solidify the route
with the DOT (3/15)**
○ Discuss final stop idea
■ People liked this idea - final event at the destination point
■ Stephen: Red Shed Garden has a portapotty but no power and the
reverse for Powers Street Garden
■ Ariel: We’re planning multiple activities at Red Shed Garden - cyanotypes,
food, seed related thing, etc. so we’d be happy to host a final event; I
don’t know in terms of clusters of gardens; we don’t necessarily need a
generator
■ David: We could also build a muffler box around a generator so that the
sound isn’t so bad
■ Stephen: Could consider renting a portapotty for Powers Street Garden if
needed as well
■ Lisa: Could check to see if there’s a business nearby that would be open
to having people use the restroom by Powers Street Garden
**■ **Garden groups at Powers Street and Red Shed to discuss idea of a
final event as the destination and to see what makes sense;** both
gardens towards the end of the proposed route anyway
○ Discuss website(Samuel Witke)
■ Interactive website with virtual tour of the gardens - map, info, etc.
■ Sample from 2019 North Brooklyn Open Garden Day
■ Could still feature all of the gardens that want to participate in the day,
regardless of whether they’re on the bike tour itself
■ Sam can start sharing a new link when this is hosted on a new community
page instead of his personal page - goal of getting more information out
there about your gardens, useful beyond this one event
■ Everyone can have access to make changes or tell Sam what edits are
needed
■ Could also just send Sam the text description for your gardens
■ Goal of an interactive map where you can see the route
**■ **Would just need a short description and photos of each
participating garden → could aim to have this by April 1st
■ **By April 30th, could aim to have more details about on-site
activities for Open Garden Day**


● Updates on event ideas for individual gardens

○ OpenGardenDay2022Form Data Samuel Witke
○ Event registration deadline
● Discuss outreach and promotion
○ Social media?
■ Eventbrite/Facebook event
● GreenThumb can help create Eventbrite sign-up links again
● Didn’t get a chance to talk about a Facebook event - pick up on
this for next time
■ Digital assets - save the date, digital map graphic
● Idea of doing social media posts on the same day - posting digital
flyers, etc. on each of the gardens’ social media pages
● Could create sample posts
● Idea of a graphic that’s a nice illustration that could be shared -
Ariel’s husband had expressed interest in helping with this
● Could have a stylized map that the gardens could take it and run
with for social media posts for their own gardens
● Could link to a QR code too so if there are updates, it’s easier
**○ **Sam is interested in helping with social media posts**
■ Videos
● North Brooklyn Parks Alliancehas created video profilesof
gardens, including some GreenThumb gardens, with theAsk a
Gardener series
**● **Could follow up with NBPA to see if they’re interested in
profiling gardens**
○ Flyers
■ GT has template flyers for individual gardens and Community Boards of
gardens - on how to join gardens generally; ****Couldcreate flyers for
individual gardens to distribute to attendees of Open Garden Day
with info about how to get involved**
● K.C. is happy to help with garden groups on creating these; main
thing is to have description of garden and a couple of photos
**■ **Could do a print / digital flyer for Open Garden Day specifically -
Ariel’s husband may be interested** → the print flyercould be drawn
from the digital flyer (or the other way around)
**● **Could share sample flyers from previous years**
○ T-shirts? Or safety vests?


```
■ **Mary is interested in thinking more about what this could look like
○ “Passport”?
■ Didn’t get a chance to talk about this - pick up on this for next time
○ Outreach to additional partners?
■ For donations?
● **Mary and Stephen are interested in thinking more about
what this could look like - potential outreach to local
businesses for snacks or giveaways
● **David Najarro is interested in reaching out to local bike
shops - to see if any of them would be up for helping with
bike repair
● **Kathy mentioned that Transportation Alternatives could
give out free bike lights
■ Promotion?
○ Local press
■ Didn’t get a chance to discuss - pick up on this for next time
```
