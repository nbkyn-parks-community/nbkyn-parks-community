### 211 South 4th Street | Brooklyn, New York 11211, El Puente: Espíritu Tierra Community Garden - Earth Spirit

El Puente coordinates the Espíritu Tierra Community Garden (201-203 South 2nd Street), a New York City Department of Parks GreenThumb garden, located on South 2nd Street between Roebling and Driggs. 

The garden has been active since its founding in 1990, when youth members from the El Puente Academy cleaned out a mountain of garbage to create a space dedicated to cultivating a peaceful space for medicinal herbs, meditation, and music. 
Today, the garden boasts a very diverse group of about 30 households and youth groups who grow food, herbs, decorative and edible flowers in the space. El Puente also organizes events, workshops, and cultural programming activities in the garden. If you are interested in joining the garden community, would like to offer your skills and resources, or are interested in holding an event or activity there, please contact Edda Figueroa: efigueroa@elpuente.us.

The mission of El Puente: Espíritu Tierra Community Garden is to:
+ Protect, maintain, and steward a community garden at 203 South 2nd Street, Brooklyn, NY
+ Provide members with opportunities for personal and communal urban gardening
+ Provide the local community with public access to ETCG during regularly scheduled times
+ Promote urban environmental stewardship in the garden and throughout the community
