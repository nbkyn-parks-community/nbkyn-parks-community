Green Dome Garden is anything but common - the plant combinations are unusual and of high quality. Small in size (2500 sq. ft) the garden provides a 'big' experience thanks to its creative use of topography, plantings and beautiful masonry. Initially the garden was created with humans in mind, but over time greater attention has been given to providing a beneficial habitat for birds and insect life which coupled with a no poison policy means that the place literally hums. Notes left for the volunteers by the public say it best: "I just spent 30 minutes in heaven", "a true oasis", and "Thanks! looking forward to another beautiful season.".

Access & Linkages

Green Dome Garden in located in McCarren Park (Williamsburg, Brooklyn), and is just a few blocks from both subway and bus stops. This community garden is unique in that it is open daily (from 9 AM till dusk) without an attendant. In order for a public space to be great - you must have access. Green Dome garden is especially popular with people who use McCarren Park regularly; for example joggers, mothers and children, elderly, dog walkers, etc. Green Dome Garden has meandering stone paths which allow people to explore without interrupting another person/family's experience. There are several benches, the most prized being a beautifully crafted dome shaped bench. Overtime the paths have been paved with Belgium blocks to improve access for the elderly, baby carriages and wheelchairs. Alternatively some areas have stepping stone paths which are accessible only by foot.
