### 227-235 N 12th St, Brooklyn, NY 11211

Green Dome was an abandoned weedy lot on the edge of McCarren Park, until in 1997, gardener Amir Yarkoni and community member Avigail Milder began transforming the space into the beautiful botanical community garden you see today.  Over the past 25 years volunteers have come and gone but the ethos of the garden remains the same: a space in the city where the community can appreciate and be close to nature.  The garden has a special place in the hearts of locals and is very often referred to as a hidden gem by those passing through McCarren Park.  Every Sunday volunteers continue to come together to care for the garden and interact with the community.
