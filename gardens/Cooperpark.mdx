Friends of Cooper Park is a group of community members who are interested in protecting and taking care of Cooper Park in partnership. We value Cooper Park as a heavily-used piece of open space in a part of the city without a lot of green space. Intensive growth in our neighborhood, and within the vicinity of Cooper Park is bringing many new residents and increasing pressure on the park. We seek to ensure that Cooper Park is resourced enough that it can continue to provide for existing residents while accommodating many more people in the coming years.
