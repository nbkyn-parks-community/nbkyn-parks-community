### 58 Java St, Brooklyn, NY 11222 Java Street Garden

Our mission is to establish a garden and public space for the larger Greenpoint area and for the enrichment of those participating in the communityâ€™s development.

Through our collective efforts and with the cooperation of local organizations, we aim to develop this space as a living laboratory for participants who wish to gain design and gardening experience and to contribute to their community.
