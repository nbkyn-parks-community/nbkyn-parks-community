# Brooklyn Greenway Initiative

### Kent Ave & N 7th St, Brooklyn, NY 11211

Brooklyn Greenway InitiativeGreen Dome Garden is anything but common - the plant combinations are unusual and of high quality. Small in size (2500 sq. ft) the garden provides a 'big' experience thanks to its creative use of topography, plantings and beautiful masonry. Initially the garden was created with humans in mind, but over time greater attention has been given to providing a beneficial habitat for birds and insect life which coupled with a no poison policy means that the place literally hums. Notes left for the volunteers by the public say it best: "I just spent 30 minutes in heaven", "a true oasis", and "Thanks! looking forward to another beautiful season.".
