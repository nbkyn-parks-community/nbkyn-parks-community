Overview:
The Northside Community Development Council started this small corner community garden in 1980 as a neighborhood beautification project. The garden contains mature cherry blossom, dogwood, and maple trees, as well as decorative plantings. It is used by neighborhood children and seniors for relaxation and education. The Northside Community Development Council is an incorporated nonprofit organization that is actively involved in many neighborhood issues, including environmental protection and affordable housing.
