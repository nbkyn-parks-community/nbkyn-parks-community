### 451 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211
La Casita Verde is a New York City Parks & GreenThumb community garden and living lab established in 2013 in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

We have over 40 raised beds and grow a range of vegetables, flowers and herbs. In the winter, members decide together what to grow each season. People do not own their own boxes but we make planting decisions together as a group and share the harvest. We also recycle food scraps and use our compost to grow food. 

The lot was vacant and a dumping ground for over four decades. It took volunteers a year to just clear out the garbage and bring in soil (over 200 cubic yards) to create a solid and safe foundation. Our original focus was composting because you can’t grow healthy food without healthy soil. For the first year, if somebody asked us what we were growing, we replied “soil!”

You can read more on our art & design pages to get a better sense of our mission, who we have been working with and what we do.
