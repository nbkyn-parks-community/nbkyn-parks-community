### 347 Keap St, Brooklyn, NY 11211 Keap Fourth

We're a nonprofit, volunteer-run garden at the corner of South 4th and Keap Streets in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Keap Fourth Community Garden promotes permaculture; organic, communal gardening; family educational programs; community advocacy and bringing the arts into gardens. Our mission is to provide our community access to open green space, environmental learning opportunities and fresh, healthy food. We are funded by the Mayor's Task Force on Obesity, GreenThumb, membership dues, donations and grants. We receive in-kind donations from Build It Green and GrowNYC and organizations that give out bulbs and seeds. Thanks to everyone's support we had an amazing first harvest!
