### 134-136 Scholes St, Brooklyn, NY 11206 Scholes Street Children's Garden

Scholes Street Childrenâ€™s Garden has been an active site for vegetable growing and community gatherings since 1986. This garden is situated one block from a building that houses the Lyons Community School, William Gaynor Intermediate School, Multicultural High School and Green School: An Academy for Environmental Careers. The garden provides students with a much-needed green space in the middle of a vast concrete landscape and paved schoolyards.
